# DESCRIPTION
## üîç Objective

The objective of this project is to build a **predictive machine learning model** that can classify whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on various clinical attributes. This fulfills **Task 2 of the CODTECH internship**, where the focus is on demonstrating the end-to-end pipeline of **data cleaning, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and human-interpretable predictions**.

## üîë Key Steps in the Project

### 1. Data Loading

* Loaded `heart.csv` using Pandas
* Explored the structure and summary statistics of the data

### 2. Data Cleaning

* Removed duplicate rows
* Verified there were no missing values
* Preserved the `HeartDisease` column as the binary target
* Applied one-hot encoding to relevant categorical columns:

  * `Sex`, `ChestPainType`, `RestingECG`, `ExerciseAngina`, `ST_Slope`

### 3. Feature Engineering

* Converted categorical features into dummy variables
* Scaled numerical features using `StandardScaler`
* Split the dataset into **train** and **test** subsets (80/20 split)

### 4. Model Training

* Trained a **Logistic Regression model** using `scikit-learn`
* Used the training set to fit the model
* Predicted outcomes on the test set

### 5. Evaluation

* Calculated **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**
* Generated a **confusion matrix** for visual performance review
* Plotted:

  * **ROC Curve** with AUC score
  * **Precision-Recall Curve** with AUC
* Performed **5-fold Cross-Validation** to check model generalizability
* Interpreted **feature coefficients** to understand predictive importance

### 6. Human-Readable Prediction Output

* Generated output like:

  * üü¢ ‚ÄúYou may not have heart disease‚Äù
  * ‚úÖ ‚ÄúYou may have heart disease‚Äù

This makes it more understandable for non-technical users.


## üìà Results Summary

| Metric                 | Score (Example) |
| ---------------------- | --------------- |
| **Accuracy**           | 0.88 (varies)   |
| **ROC AUC**            | 0.93+           |
| **PR AUC**             | 0.92+           |
| **Cross-Val Accuracy** | \~0.86 ¬± 0.02   |


## üìå Conclusion

This project demonstrates how supervised machine learning, combined with proper data cleaning and preprocessing, can build a robust binary classifier for medical prediction.
